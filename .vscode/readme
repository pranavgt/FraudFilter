Fraud Filter

A simple scam-detection tool to help protect people (especially seniors) from online fraud, phishing, and scam messages.

📖 Overview

Our project is a scam detection tool for seniors. Users can either paste text or upload a screenshot of a message. The app extracts text with OCR, checks it against scam keywords like “urgent” or “wire transfer,” and shows a verdict. It also stores a history of all checks so family members can review past messages and spot scam patterns.

Fraud Filter is a lightweight tool that checks suspicious emails, texts, or call transcripts for common scam patterns such as:

Urgent language (“ACT NOW!”, “final notice”)

Demands for unusual payment methods (gift cards, crypto, wire transfers)

Fake authority claims (IRS, FBI, Amazon “support”)

Threatening language (lawsuit, warrant, arrest)

Suspicious links that don’t match the brand

Phone number requests

It produces a risk score and a simple explanation of why the message looks dangerous.
